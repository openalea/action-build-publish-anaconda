# Test Setup

A reusable workflow that test [setup-ci action](https://github.com/openalea/action-build-publish-anaconda/blob/main/setup-ci/action.yml) for different simulated scenario (push, pull request, ...) to check that the [rules defined for CI] (https://github.com/openalea/action-build-publish-anaconda/blob/main/README.md) are correctly implemented.

The workflow can be call manualy (workflow dispath) from the Actions page of the repo. Its outputs can be inspected under the 'Test Results' section of the run.
